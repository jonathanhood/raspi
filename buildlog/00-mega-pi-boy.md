# Mega Pi Boy Build Log

* [Next](01-carnage.md)

This log is my own take to the [Game Boy Zero](https://www.sudomod.com/wiki/index.php/Game_Boy_Zero)
but using a [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

I have some clear goals for myself with this build:

1. The end result should be capable of playing Super FX SNES games (e.g.
   Super Mario RPG, Yoshi's Island, and Star Fox) without any performance
   issues or frame dropping.
2. The performance needed to play these games should last for more than a
   few minutes. In other words, the resulting build should not excessively.
3. The result should run off a battery and, as a result, fit within a ~5v/800ma
   _maximum_ power budget.
